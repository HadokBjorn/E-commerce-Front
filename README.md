# Cat Store

## About App

<img src='./src/assets/sign-up.gif'>

The CatStore app is an original project created with MongoDB and React that simulates the basic functionality of an e-commerce platform selling products for cat owners.

The app allows users to browse the product catalog without logging in, but when they try to purchase a product, they are redirected to the login screen.

If the user doesn't have an account, they can register by clicking on the "Primeira vez? Cadastre-se!" text, which will redirect them to the registration screen.

After registration, the customer can select the products they are interested in and add them to their shopping cart.

By clicking on the "shopping cart" icon, the user can view the list of selected products and the total value of their purchase.

Access the application through this link https://cat-store-ecommerce.vercel.app/ ; it may take a while to load as the hosting platform provides limited resources in the free version.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
